I am a Data Scientist with expertise in SQL, Python, and data visualization, used to collaborate in multidisciplinary teams. 

I am proficient at gathering requirements, automating workflows, and delivering actionable insights. 

Passionate about data, I also work on analytics and machine learning projects in my spare time and regularly take online courses to learn new subjects.


## Projects

(from newest to oldest)

### Optimizing Traffic Flow in New York City: Predictive Modeling and Strategic Insights from Telemetry Data

[<i class="fas fa-chart-area"></i> Report](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/bbed1362-0471-4255-8e9c-1d30be4c1284)

Integrated a dataset containing telemetry data from two taxi drivers in New York with geographical data, developed Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost models to predict trip duration, and provided recommendations for New York City and the taxi company.


### Post-Pruned Trees and Gradient Boosting to Predict Cardiovascular Disease

[<i class="fab fa-kaggle"></i> Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adiugm/post-pruned-trees-and-gradient-boosting)

Used post-pruned trees and gradient boosting to predict cardiovascular disease in well-balance dataset with few features and reduced size.

If competition was still ongoing, this solution would have placed 3rd, with an accuracy of 0.72666.


### Customer Transactions - Data Bank (RFM Analysis)

[<i class="fab fa-kaggle"></i> Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adiugm/customer-transaction-analysis-data-bank)

### Data Competition - *Was a Website Redesign Successful?*

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Code](https://github.com/fmsrosa/Website-design-A-B-testing)

My submission to the competition "Was a Website Redesign Successful?" evaluates four website designs using A/B testing, recommending the most effective one with 95% confidence and including probabilities for Type I and Type II errors.

It also serves as a tutorial on A/B testing using z-scores and power analysis.

### Data Cleaning and translation project - *Retail Turnover Index in Portugal*

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Code](https://github.com/fmsrosa/retail_turnover/)

Cleaned a dataset from Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica by imputing missing data and splitting string columns into multiple fields for clarity; translated Portuguese values to ensure standardization, dropped unnecessary columns, renamed fields, and sorted the data.
