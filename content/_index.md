I am a Data Scientist with expertise in SQL, Python, and data visualization, used to collaborate in multidisciplinary teams. 

I am proficient at gathering requirements, automating workflows, and delivering actionable insights. 

Passionate about data, I also work on analytics and machine learning projects in my spare time and regularly take online courses to learn new subjects.


## Projects

(from newest to oldest)

### Price Model deployed on GCP using Docker

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Code](https://github.com/fmsrosa/dynamic_pricing_app)

Created a Gradio web app, containerized it with Docker, registered the image in Google Artifact Registry, and deployed it on Google Cloud Run.

### Solving Classic Childhood Games with OpenCV and scikit-image

Explored image processing with Python by solving childhood puzzles. 

Using OpenCV and scikit-image, spotted differences in images by comparing their structural similarity, solved mazes through basic image transformations, and detected objects regardless of scale via template matching.

### Gender Classification with BiLSTM and Attention Mechanism (PyTorch)

[<i class="fab fa-kaggle"></i> Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adiugm/gender-classification-bilstm-attention)

Classified names by gender using a Bidirectional LSTM combined with a simple attention mechanism, using PyTorch. 

The dataset consists of first names, which are encoded into integer sequences. The model processes these sequences to predict gender, with the output being a probability of male or female. 

Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC.

### Feedback Submission Platform with Streamlit, EC2, and S3 Integration

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Code](https://github.com/fmsrosa/streamlit_rfm_app)

Developed a Streamlit web application hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The app presents users with a table and prompts them to enter their name and opinion for each row. Once users are satisfied with their inputs, they can submit the data using a submit button.

Upon submission, the data is saved to a pre-configured Amazon S3 bucket when running on EC2. If S3 is inaccessible, the data is stored locally as a fallback.

### Understanding Diabetes Incidence: Feature Selection, Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation

[<i class="fas fa-code"></i> Code](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/906bc7be-049d-4572-9ed7-61b7dc8922bb/edit)

Integrated a medical dataset to analyze diabetes incidence, performed feature selection, and tuned hyperparameters of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost models using coarse-to-fine and Bayesian optimization approaches to enhance recall scores.

### Optimizing Traffic Flow in New York City: Predictive Modeling and Strategic Insights from Telemetry Data

[<i class="fas fa-chart-area"></i> Report](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/bbed1362-0471-4255-8e9c-1d30be4c1284)

[<i class="fas fa-code"></i> Code](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/bbed1362-0471-4255-8e9c-1d30be4c1284/edit)

Integrated a dataset containing telemetry data from two taxi drivers in New York with geographical data, developed Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost models to predict trip duration, and provided recommendations for New York City and the taxi company.


### Post-Pruned Trees and Gradient Boosting to Predict Cardiovascular Disease

[<i class="fab fa-kaggle"></i> Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adiugm/post-pruned-trees-and-gradient-boosting)

Used post-pruned trees and gradient boosting to predict cardiovascular disease in well-balance dataset with few features and reduced size.

If competition was still ongoing, this solution would have placed 3rd, with an accuracy of 0.72666.
